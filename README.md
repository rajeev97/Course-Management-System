What is it:
We have created a course management system, for the IT department which would help the newcomer students to choose their respective electives and manage their credit requirements in addition to knowing their core courses for the semester. As we can see while joining into an engineering college we need to fill the course registration form to choose respective courses of particular credit.as for graduation, we required a minimum number of credits to be completed. So by keeping this idea in mind we created a GUI which will show the buttons of a student who have the roll number and will ask for the semester and according to the semester the program will ask for electives to be chosen and a number of credits the student completed and the graduation status.This is aimed at making the process of course management for IT students easier and to spread awareness among all the students as to what they have to study in the future. 


How to Use it:
1. Button Add Student
This button adds the respective student by taking in their name and roll number  as input and adding it to a student array list, which stores all the student objects.We can add more than one student in a go. 
 

2.Search Student Button
This button takes the roll number of the student as input and displays the respective courses for the semester and the credits he/she has completed, as well as the current semester number and other important details pertaining exclusively to the student himself.

3.Resolve Credit Discrepencies Button
This button is useful for the elective courses. It manages if the students have chosen their respective electives based on their credit requirement. The user is prompted to enter the number of credits that he wishes to complete through electives. Once the appropriate number is entered, the electives are chosen based on the interest of the student. This button is an integral part of the elective management. 

4. Click to Run one semester button
this button runs the semester for the student and the credits for the courses taken are totalled and updated for the student. This can simultaneously update the credits for more than one student. 

5.Click to Exit Program Button
This button ensures that the program is safely terminated.
